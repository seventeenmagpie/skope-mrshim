Changes and improvements:
 - Data is now fetched from Skope block-by-block rather than per acquisition,
 - The removed client identifier was falling through if it couldn't match a client,
 - Implemented a "!hold" command in the MRShim client that just means the same currents are applied, regardless of what !shim commands are sent,
 - Documented the above,

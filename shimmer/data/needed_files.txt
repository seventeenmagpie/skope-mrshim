These files all have generic names. Although they all store metadata, so any detail can be recovered, you should use copies if you care about them.

Shimmer needs the following data files to operate:
 - A .scan file for probe positions and offsets, ensure the scanid in the matlab matches the number at the start of the filename.
 - A field map (.PAR/.REC) with a magnitude image from which to make a mask, named field_map.PAR/field_map.REC.
 - A coils_tmp.npy from Arche on the MRShim laptop made using the field map.

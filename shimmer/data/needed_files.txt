skope_temp contains all the raw scan data from Skope. This isn't used in the program, but it is stored. 
Good idea to clear this out routinely. 
I haven't automated the clearing because I figure you might want the files for offline use.

Shimmer needs the following data files to operate:
 - A .scan file for probe positions and offsets,
 - A field map (.PAR/.REC) with a magnitude image from which to make a mask,
 - A coils_tmp.npy from Arche on the MRShim laptop made using the field map,
